# P2P Encrypted Chat Application

This is a basic peer-to-peer (P2P) encrypted chat application that uses RSA encryption for secure communication between two peers. The project includes features for generating RSA keys, encrypting messages, and exchanging encrypted messages in real-time over a socket connection.

The entire code for this project was **completely generated by AI**. The repository also includes steps to set up and run the application.

## Features

- **RSA Encryption**: Secure communication using public-key encryption.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct connection between peers without a centralized server.
- **Multithreaded Messaging**: Enables simultaneous sending and receiving of messages.
- **Key Exchange**: Public keys are exchanged for message encryption, keeping private keys secure.

## Files

1. **`rsa_utils.py`**: Utility functions for RSA key generation, encryption, decryption, and key file management.
2. **`peer.py`**: Manages P2P socket communication and multithreading for handling incoming and outgoing messages.
3. **`p2p_chat.py`**: The main script that integrates everything and allows users to start a chat as either a server or a client.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (install with `pip install cryptography`)

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p2p_encrypted_chat.git
   cd p2p_encrypted_chat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

3. **Run the Chat Application**:
   - On one terminal, start the server:
     ```bash
     python p2p_chat.py
     ```
     Follow the prompts to set up as a server.

   - On another terminal, connect as a client:
     ```bash
     python p2p_chat.py
     ```
     Follow the prompts to connect to the server.

4. **Start Chatting**: Exchange encrypted messages in real-time.
